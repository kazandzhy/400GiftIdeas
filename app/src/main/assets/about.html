    <p>Hello, my name is <span style="color:blue;">Vlad Kazandzhy</span>, and I am the developer of this Android application.</p>
    <p>This application is not intended to show all possible gift ideas. There are so many things and inventions in the world today, and their number will only increase in the future. Also, the application does not show specific gifts, but rather <span style="color:blue;">directs users to websites</span> where they can choose something based on their personal preferences. The main purpose of this project is to offer <span style="color:blue;">a variety of ideas for gifts</span>, and after that you more than welcome to come up with something of your own.</p>
    <p>In the application, you can find ideas for gifts according to the <span style="color:blue;">age</span> of the person, <span style="color:blue;">life interests</span>, and <span style="color:blue;">gender</span>. You can also find ideas for a <span style="color:blue;">special event</span>, and in the section <span style="color:blue;">Extras</span>, there are additional gift ideas that are suitable for everyone.</p>
    <p>In the top right menu, you can try the <span style="color:blue;">Random Gift</span> function if you'd like to randomly browse the <span style="color:blue;">400+</span> gift ideas. Also, on the <span style="color:blue;">Contact Us</span> page, you can send your own gift ideas, a new gift category, or a gift website that you enjoy, or you can share your opinion or ideas about the app.</p>
    <p><br>With respect and best wishes,
        <br>Vlad Kazandzhy</p>
