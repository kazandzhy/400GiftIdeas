            <h1>Useful tips for choosing a gift</h1>
            <p>Choosing a gift is a kind of ritual. After all, through gift-giving, you express your attitude and feelings towards a person. The success of the gift depends on how surprising it is. It can be accompanied by a creative greeting in the form of a handwritten note.</p>
            <p>But not everything is so simple. Constantly we have to puzzle over what to give someone. By following the rules below, you can give not only a gift but also positive emotions that will lift the mood of the recipient.</p>

            <h2>Rule #1: Determine how close you are to the person and how much you are willing to spend</h2>
            <p>For example, if you’re going to your friend’s birthday party, then count on one price, but if you’re gift-shopping for a colleague at work, that will likely be a different price. People you are close to can be given needed things, like an electric toothbrush, a towel, a nice bathrobe, perfume, and bed linen.</p>
            <p>For your boss, it would be better to give a souvenir related to their professional activities or hobbies, for example a nice planner or a leather notebook. If their hobby is tennis, you can give a tennis racket or a racket case. Those who love hunting and fishing would surely appreciate a gift card to a specialized outdoor shop.</p>

            <h2>Rule #2: Consider the opinions and desires of the recipient, not your own preferences</h2>
            <p>There are two ways to find out what a person wants to be given. The first is to simply ask the person, but then the gift won’t be a surprise. The other option, which is the best way, is to ask friends and family about the person’s preferences. For example, when you are invited to a child’s birthday party, you can ask the parents in advance what kind of games and activities the child is interested in or what they like to collect.</p>

            <h2>Rule #3: Gifts don’t always have to be expensive</h2>
            <p>After all, the main thing about gift-giving is the attention you show to the recipient. If you give an overly expensive gift, the person may feel obliged to give you something of a similar price in return, but this is not always possible and may create an uncomfortable situation.</p>
            <p>Gifts can be inexpensive yet still original and interesting. For example, you could give a cake with a creative design or an object with something printed on it. Even just writing kind words on a beautifully-wrapped chocolate bar would surely lift the mood of the recipient.</p>
